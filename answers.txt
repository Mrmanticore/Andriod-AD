1)What are type conversions?
Type conversions are the process of converting one data type to another in programming languages. 
In Android, type conversions are important to ensure that the correct data types are used in different parts of the code. 
For example, converting a string to an integer or vice versa.

2)What is Null Safety?
Null Safety is a feature in Kotlin that helps to avoid NullPointerException errors. 
It ensures that variables are not null unless they are explicitly declared as such, 
preventing runtime errors that can occur when a null value is unexpectedly encountered.

3)Explain Collections of Kotlin
Collections in Kotlin are a set of classes that provide a way to store and manipulate groups of objects. 
They include lists, sets, and maps, which can be mutable or immutable. 
Collections are a fundamental part of programming in Kotlin, and 
they are often used in Android development to manage data.

4)What is Android Architecture?
Android architecture refers to the way that Android applications are structured and organized. 
It includes the different components of an Android application, such as activities, services, and broadcast receivers, 
as well as the way these components interact with each other.

5)What is Android virtual device?
An Android Virtual Device (AVD) is a software emulation of an Android device that can be used to test and 
run Android applications on a computer. AVDs are created using the Android Virtual Device Manager 
in Android Studio and can be customized to simulate different types of devices with various screen sizes, 
hardware configurations, and Android versions.

6)What are application components?
Application components are the building blocks of an Android application. 
They include activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers, 
which are used to provide functionality and interact with the user and other parts of the system.

7)What is broadcast receiver?
A broadcast receiver is a component in an Android 
application that listens for system-wide broadcast messages. 
It can be used to trigger an action in response to a specific broadcast event, 
such as receiving a phone call or a text message.

8)Explain widgets.
Widgets are small graphical user interface (GUI) elements that provide 
quick access to specific functions or information. In Android, widgets can be added to the home screen or 
lock screen to display data or provide shortcuts to frequently used features.

9)Explain notification.
Notifications are messages that are displayed on the 
Android device to inform the user about events or updates. 
They can be used to alert the user about incoming calls, text messages, emails, or other notifications.

10)Explain List menu
List menu is a user interface element that displays a list of options for the user to choose from. 
It is often used in Android applications to provide a menu of choices for the user, such as selecting a language or a theme.

11)What are Android controls?
Android controls are user interface elements that are used to interact with the user 
and provide input and output for an Android application. 
They include buttons, text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and other graphical elements.

12)What are style and themes in Android?
Styles and themes are used in Android to define the visual appearance of an application. 
They provide a way to define common styles and apply them to multiple components or activities within an application, 
making it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel. Styles are used to define the appearance of individual UI elements, 
while themes are used to apply styles to the entire application or activity.
